# pudzu-packages

## Summary

Various Python 3.6+ packages, mostly geared towards dataviz and used to create the data visualisations in this [flickr account](https://www.flickr.com/photos/zarfo/albums) (most of which been posted to reddit at some point by [/u/Udzu](https://www.reddit.com/user/Udzu/)). The packages aren't properly tested yet but are reasonably simple, generic and docstringed.
